Computer literacy and programming are being taught increasingly at the K-12 level with more students than ever matriculating in college with prior programming experience. Accurately assessing student programming skills acquired in high school can inform college faculty about the range of competencies in introductory programming courses. The tool predominantly-used for assessing past CS knowledge and skills is a survey, which lacks quantitative rigor. This study aims to (1) quantify the effects of prior knowledge in entry-level programming courses and (2) compare the different measurement approaches of student prior knowledge in programming, including surveys and aptitude tests. The results of this study reveal that a discrepancy exists between the results of surveys and aptitude tests. Consistent with prior survey studies, our survey results showed that the effects of student prior programming knowledge faded gradually during the course period. In contrast, the aptitude test results indicated that the effects of student prior knowledge did not weaken over time. The accuracy of both measurements and implications for instructors were further discussed.

I designed the conducted the survey / quiz study with the help from colleagues [Yan Liu](https://ecps.educ.ubc.ca/person/yan-liu/) and her student Vishal Gupta at University of British Columbia. My student, [David Smith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-smith-1b9499102), performed the data analysis and took lead on writing this paper. Overall this study raised more questions than answers, especially the findings on differences of different CS prior knowledge measurements. We expect at least one more sequential study on this topic.
