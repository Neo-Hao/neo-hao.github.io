It has been three months since I accepted an offer of a tenure-track faculty position that I really love, and by then I had been doing job hunting for almost seven months, in both industry and academia. As everything about job hunting is still fresh in my memory, I hope to record some of my experience before I start forgetting. Hopefully, my experience could come useful to you.

I will limit the the whole discussion to the things that we do have control of from now on. Thinking about what I learnt from others and my own experience, I have to say the single most important thing is PLANNING AHEAD. There are a lot of things other scholars attach great importance to, such as the quality/number of publications and teaching experience. These credentials can not be gained in short time. If we regard job hunting as a task composed of multiple subtasks, more than 60% of the subtasks (see Fig 1) should have the status of "DONE" when you start job hunting, which typically happen by the last second summer of your Ph.D. study.

Therefore, if you still determine to stay in academia, you need to start preparing form the very first year of your Ph.D. study. You may hear a lot that research is much more important than teaching, but I tend not to fully agree with such a statement. There are many reasons for this, but most of them could be irrelevant when you have job hunting in your mind. However, there are still two relevant reasons I could think of:

1. You are very likely to be required to give both a research talk and a teaching demo when you get an onsite job interview. Teaching experience really helps you do a better job on both talks.
2. You do not know what type of universities you will join in later. Some of them emphasises research more than teaching, some of them treat them equally, and some focuses more on teaching. 

It literally takes a lot of time to prepare and practice to be a good communicator, then some passion to be a good teacher. I taught large-scale classes (with more than 100 students per class) for four years before I started doing my graduate school. If you did not have much real teaching experience before starting your Ph.D., you really want to seize some opportunities to practice.

As for the service, you have many things to do during your Ph.D., such as contributing to your departmental student organization, getting involved in professional activities for a conference, or helping with routine reviews for a conference. All these things should help. There are of course certain things that help you stand out, such as being invited to review for reputed journals, or chairing a session in an important conference. However, such opportunities usually need you to have several publications and some experience as volunteer reviewers. One thing that I learnt is that DO NOT BE SHY ABOUT ASKING. If you already have some experience in publishing and voluntary review, go ahead and ask faculties in your department to refer some reviews to you. You can even send emails directly to journal editors, giving a pitch of yourself as a potentially reliable reviewer; many of the emails would of course stay unreplied, but two to three positive responses would surely bring one review opportunity to you.
 
All the things listed above could take a long time, so make sure you start early.

Secondly, <strong>what is the most important thing when you officially start job hunting and put yourself on market?</strong> Well, every step is important when it comes to writing your cover letters/teaching philosophy/research statements, having your recommendation letter submitted in time, or preparing for the actual interviews. The thing that I see most important is to have a right mindset. Job hunting is not intellectually challenging, but very laborious. When you start job hunting, be prepared to do everything over and over to make it perfect. 

As for searching for positions/submitting applications, you will need to learn how to set email alerts, if you didn’t ever use similar functions before. Big hiring sites include:

* <a href="https://www.higheredjobs.com/" target="_blank">HigherEdJobs</a>
* <a href="https://chroniclevitae.com/job_search/new" target="_blank">ChronicleVitae</a>
* <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/" target="_blank">TimesHigherEducation</a>

There are also hiring websites special to different fields, usually affiliated with conferences. For instance, there are a lot of educational related jobs on <a href="http://careers.aera.net/jobseeker/search/results/" target="_blank">AERA career site</a>; many information science jobs could be found on <a href="http://ischools.org/jobs/" target="_blank">ischool website</a>. Make sure that you use as many keywords as possible when defining your email alerts with these websites. In addition, you will need to check manually every two to three weeks on these websites or websites of youor favorite universities, just in case you may miss something. <strong>If possible, you should try applying as many as possible</strong>. I applied for more than 60 faculty positions, mainly in three different fields: computer science education, information science, and instructional technology, and received 7 interview invitations.

I understand that many people hesitate to apply for more positions, mainly because of the difficulties of getting recommendation letters. I don’t think it as a problem at all. Most universities ask for reference lists instead of recommendation letters nowadays. I think there were only 20 out the 60 that I applied for asking for recommendation letters (Only one old-fashioned school asked for paper letter). I did hear from other students complaining about the time it took for them to get their letters sent. However, I didn’t experience any issues myself, and all my referees were very helpful. If you stand from the point of a faculty, you will see how busy life is for them, and you apparently know your strengths much better than any of them. <strong>Therefore, if you could give them some help, like drafting something beforehand, it would really help them finish a letter fast</strong>.

As for writing of the cover letters/teaching philosophy/research statements, you will need to spend a lot of time developing a set of “root documents”, and adapt them for different positions you apply. If it is a research intensive university, you will need to stress your research experience; if it is a teaching school, you need to focus on your teaching experience in the application writings. You will be very likely to revise your root documents for at least 5 times. <strong>It is very important to show your application writings to different people for suggestions</strong>, including your advisors, friends, colleagues and family members, and make sure you push them hard for honest opinions. 

The preparation of remote/onsite interviews share some similarities on question & answer interactions. <strong>It is important for you to prepare both answers to common questions and possible questions for the department head, search committee, and other faculty members</strong>. The reason is that except for being asked many questions, there is usually a time slot arranged for you to ask them questions. You can easily find common question lists online, and you should prepare as many as possible. The common question list I used comes from <a href="http://pgbovine.net/guo-faculty-job-search.pdf" target="_blank">Dr. Philip Guo</a>, and I wrote down my answers to each question for around 10 pages for practice purposes. It is very likely that none of the questions you prepare for would be asked, but the preparation process could really help you think through how to explain your research to others, and give you a boost to your interaction with the interviewers. For your reference, here is <a href="http://neo-hao.github.io/downloads/possible_questions_to_ask.pdf" target="_blank">a list of possible questions to ask</a> that I put together from multiple sources. 

In addition to question & answer interactions, onsite interviews require you to give both a research talk and a teaching demo. There are several lessons that I learnt from others’ experience in terms of the research talk and teaching demo:

1. <strong>Set at least 25% of the time of research talk for your future research plan</strong>. Interviewers are more interested in your future plans than what you have done, as what you have done can be learnt from your resume.
2. <strong>Do not keep talking by yourself during the teaching demo</strong>. Interaction with others is the key, and you will need to adjust your pace or make decisions on whether to skip certain content based on the interaction. Thus, you need to design interactions in your teaching demo.
3. <strong>Be sure you are within the given time limit</strong>. It is usually one of the most important evaluation criterion. Besides, think about how busy a faculty can be in a regular working day.
4. <strong>You will need to deliver both the research talk and teaching demo in an authentic environments with different audience (e.g., your advisors or your friends) for at least three times beforehand</strong>. In other words, you would probably need to practice by yourself for more than 10 times even before the delivery practice.
5. <strong>Buy a wireless clicker</strong>. It really helps when you walk around on the teaching stage. You don’t really want to be stuck to the position of your laptop.

There are many other questions that are important in terms of job hunting in academia, most of the questions in terms of the onsite interview process are very well answered in <a href="http://pgbovine.net/guo-faculty-job-search.pdf" target="_blank">the reflection from Dr. Philip Guo</a>. I will squeeze some time to write about telephone/skype interview in the coming weeks.
