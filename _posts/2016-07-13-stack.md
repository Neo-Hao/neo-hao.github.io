### Leetcode Question 71
Given an absolute path for a file (Unix-style), simplify it. For example,

{% highlight python %}
path = "/home/", => "/home"
path = "/a/./b/../../c/", => "/c"
{% endhighlight %}

Analysis:

1. The application of stack is pretty easy.
2. When there is the pattern such that the occurance of A will erase the occurance of B, consider using a stack.

Code:

{% highlight python %}
class Solution(object):
    def simplifyPath(self, path):
        places = [p for p in path.split("/") if p!="." and p!=""]
        stack = []
        for p in places:
            if p == "..":
                if len(stack) > 0:
                    stack.pop()
            else:
                stack.append(p)
        return "/" + "/".join(stack)
{% endhighlight %}
