title: Book Recommendation - Algorithms to Live By
---

<p>Since computational thinking becomes a hot topic, many educational researchers rushed in studying it. Yet it is not easy for a person without solid background knowledge of computer science to appreciate the usefulness of computational thinking, let alone jumping directly to researching on its learning and teaching.</p>
 
<p>Reading off the definition directly from textbooks edited by computer scientists does not really help an educational researcher understand recursions, pattern recognition, or algorithmic thinking. For instance, the definition of algorithmic thinking reads as developing the step by step instructions for solving similar problems. This definition can easily give the impression that algorithms are no more than rigid deductive logics that enumerate options and grind out answers despite of how long and hard it is to think. After talking to many educational researchers who work on this topic, I realized two things:</p>

1. Many of them do not have a good understanding of how computational thinking could come useful in their daily life at all
2. The practicality of computational thinking could hardly be learnt by reading papers from other scholars.
 
<p>If an educational researcher who studies this topic is empowered with such knowledge, his understanding of this research topic and his own research design could be further strengthened; if a middle school teacher who is teaching related content understands how computational thinking could be beneficial to his personal life, his delivery to students could be much more enlightening. Therefore, I have been thinking about how to convey the usefulness of computational thinking to adults who do not know much about computer science for a while. It is important that adults learn how computational thinking can be applied to their life first, before they can contribute significantly to this topic.</p>

<p>If you are an educational researcher who was never majoring in computer science before but is interested in studying computational thinking education, or if you are a graduate student who is instructed to do a literature survey on this topic, this book could be a very good start for you before you jump to those less entertaining academic papers. Many topics covered in the book could be very relevant to things in your daily life, important or trivial, such as:</p>
 
* What is the best strategy to find a good rental in a harrowing city
* What strategy you should use to sell your house to maximize the profit
* When you should try new restaurants
* ......
