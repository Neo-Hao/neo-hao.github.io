This course aims to introduce you to the analysis of algorithms and data structures in a mathematically rigorous fashion. We will cover the necessary mathematical fundamentals and then delve into worst-case, probabilistic and amortized analysis techniques. We will apply these techniques to sorting algorithms and classic data structures. 

Upon completion of this course, you will demonstrate:

* Basic understanding of the mathematical concepts of asymptotic notation, recurrence relations  and loop invariants
* Basic understanding of worst-case, probabilistic and amortized analysis techniques
* Thorough understanding of the complexity of sorting algorithms and common data structures,  such as heaps, trees and hash tables
* Thorough understanding of divide and conquer
* Basic understanding of the formulation and analysis of probabilistic algorithms
* The ability to analyze and formulate solutions for abstract problems
* The ability to derive the time complexity of basic algorithms
* The ability to use mathematical reasoning in correctness proofs of algorithms

Here are the tentative topics that will be covered in this course:
