I started doing my Ph.D. degree in Learning Science and M.Sc. in Computer Science from 2013, and graduated from both in 2017. Looking back at my journey, one thing that I regretted in my personal life is that I had very limited knowledge about how to manage my money. I did not started gaining the knowledge purposefully until the very last two year of my Ph.D. study, given that the life of a graduate student is always too busy for anything else. 
 
However, as soon as I started learning, I realized how important the knowledge of managing my money is, and how important it is to start early. I hope I could share what I have learnt with all my fellow graduate students, who are buried in paper writing, coding or lab experiments. Hopefully, the posts here can help you quickly see how to:
 
* minimize your necessary spendings
* maximize your income through different channels
