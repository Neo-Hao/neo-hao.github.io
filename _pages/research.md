**I am always looking for talented and hard-working students. If you are interested in joining my lab, please shoot me an email at qiang.hao@wwu.edu.**

My research lab members work on different aspects of computing education, including studying effective pedagogical approaches, tracking & analyzing learning behaviors, and developing next generation technologies supporting learning and teaching of programming. Some recently published papers and open-sourced software from my lab include:
