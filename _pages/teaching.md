I have taught a variety of courses at Western Washington University, including:

* Database Systems
* Object Oriented Design
* Web Programming
* Mobile Programming
* Data Structure
* Computer Programming and Linear Data Structures
* Computing Education Research

I am dedicated to provide high-quality open educational resources (OER) on computing education. I won an OER award from Western Washington University to develop interactive OER for two CS courses, including:

* Data Structures: This is a core course for all CS majors at Western Washington University. The interactive textbook/notebook/tutorial under development can be found at <https://github.com/Neo-Hao/data-structures>.

* Java Programming and Linear Data Structure: This is a core course for all CS majors at Western Washington University. This is also a prerequisite course for Data Structures. The interactive textbook/notebook/tutorial under development can be found at <https://github.com/Neo-Hao/java-programming-notebook>.
