I am dedicated to provide high-quality open educational resources (OER) on computing education. I won an OER award from Western Washington University to develop interactive OER for two CS courses, including:

### Data Structures

This is a core course for all CS majors at Western Washington University.
The interactive textbook/notebook/tutorial under development can be found at <https://github.com/Neo-Hao/data-structures>.

### Java Programming and Linear Data Structure

This is a core course for all CS majors at Western Washington University. This is also a prerequisite course for Data Structures.
The interactive textbook/notebook/tutorial under development can be found at <https://github.com/Neo-Hao/java-programming-notebook>.
