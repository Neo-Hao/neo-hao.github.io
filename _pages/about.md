I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Western Washington University. I am the lead author of <a href='https://mng.bz/PRER'>Grokking Relational Database Design</a>, an illustrated book published by Manning, one of the largest techincal book publisher. This hands-on guide simplifies complex database design concepts through practical examples and visual explanations.

My research interests include computing education, human-computer interaction, and software engineering. I have published numerous peer-reviewed and widely cited papers in top-tier venues, including *ACM Transactions on Computing Education*, *ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education*, and *Computers in Human Behavior*. I am currently working on the learning and teaching of software testing. As a passionate educator, I am also exploring how to produce <a href='https://www.youtube.com/@qhaocs'>high-quality video lectures</a> to enhance flipped classrooms and online learning.
