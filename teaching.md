I am frequently teaching the following courses at Western Washington University.

### Computer Programming and Linear Data Structures

This is a core course for students at Western to get admitted to CS major, also CS2 in the eyes of many experienced CS instructors. This course is challenging for several reasons:

* This is the first time that many students get introduced to Java Programming
* This is the first time that many students get introduced to data structure
* Some meta-skills need to be picked up along learning programming, including how to use IDEs, version control, and collaborative programming.

### Data Structures

This is another core course for students at Western to get admitted to CS major. The performance of this course will be used with performances from other two courses to collectively determine if a student can be successfully admitted to CS major. Other than that, this course is fully dedicated to data structure.
