My research group, the CompEd Lab, includes students from a variety of disciplines, such as computer science, engineering, education and design.

I run the lab in a doctoral student-centered manner: students define their own projects within the scope of my interests, and often move me into new research areas. I typically write grants to support students' research, rather than make students work within the grant money I've raised. Students frequently collaborate with each other and with students outside of the lab.

I run my research group in a flexible manner: I can provide you a well-defined problem that leads to software products or research papers. Or you can bring a project of your interest, and I can help you refine the idea and make further plans.

If you are a student at Western Washington University looking for senior projects, independent study, or graduate study, you can bring your own topics or join one of my <a href="research" target="_blank">ongoing research projects</a>.
