Michale and I have both taught database design to students and professionals for many years. We have seen people struggle with the same concepts over and over again. We wanted to create a resource that would help people learn these concepts in a friendly and approachable way.

In the past two years, we have been working on this book. We have been writing, revising, and sometimes rewriting everything. We have been working with a talented illustrator, Cody Pham, who has helped us create a visual language that makes the concepts easier to understand. We have also been working with a team of editors and reviewers at Manning Pulbications to make sure that the content is accurate and clear.

If you are interested in learning more about the book, you can find it on the [Manning Publications website](https://mng.bz/PRER). You can also find a free sample chapter there. The book is available on Manning now and will be available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Grokking-Relational-Database-Design-Qiang/dp/1633437418) towards the end of April 2025. 

I am currently working on producing a series of videos to accompany the book. The videos will be available on the Manning website and on YouTube soon.
