As most property management companies or lenders charge high-rate transaction fees for credit cards, it might be better to stick to using debit cards. However, there are two exceptions when you want to consider using your credit cards to pay the monthly bill (directly or indirectly):
 
1. **Scenario 1**: You just got approved for a new credit card, but you may not be able to meet the spending requirement for sign-up bonus if you stick to your routine expenditure.
2. **Scenario 2**: You don't take full advantage of your credit cards that give you +3% cashback bonus, but you want to.
 
Plastiq provides a type of interesting service that I found perfect for the above two given scenarios. What does Plastiq do? In brief, Plastiq charges money from your credit cards or prepaid gift cards with 2.5% transaction fee, and send checks to pay your monthly bills. Why did I find it great? ---
 
**Scenario 1**
 
I pretty much hate to create unnecessary expenditures. I can easily reach the spending requirement of sign-up bonus by using Plastiq to pay my rentals for maximum three times (usually one). When this is the case, I let Plastiq charge directly from my credit cards.
 
I hesitate to buy gift cards for spending requirement of sign-up bonus, as many cards do not count such spending towards the their spending requirements.
 
**Scenario 2**
 
Some credit cards give you back +3% for certain categories of shopping. For example, <a href = "https://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/card/blue-cash-preferred/" target="_blank">Amex BlueCash Preferred</a> gives back 6% up to the annual cashback $360 for grocery shopping. In other words, you can't spend more than $6000 for groceries a year, you might consider using Amex + Plastiq to pay your rentals, and get around 3% cashback.
 
It takes several steps:
 
1. Buy multiple $500 visa / master / amex gift cards. <i>Always buy $500 per gift card to maximize your cashback because of activation fee</i>.
2. Call gift card companies or go online to register the gift cards so you can use them for online shopping.
3. Add the gift cards to Plastiq, and add check the information of check recipient. For each $500 gift card, you can send up to $485 check to pay you rental because of 2.5% transaction fee. You may need to send multiple checks to pay your monthly rental.
 
One thing to keep in mind is that it takes time for the check to reach the recipient, so you need to do this early if you use the service of Plastiq. As an example, suppose you you follow the above steps to pay $800 monthly rental, you probably end up doing the followings:
 
1. Buy 2 Amex gift card at $500 per card. <i>Amex gift card has the lowest activation fee as $3.95</i>.
2. Call Amex customer service to register both gift cards. <i>Amex only allows gift card registration through phone calls</i>.
3. Add the gift card and the recipient information on Plastiq. Arrange Plastiq to send one check of $485 and the other of $315 to the property management company. <i>The reason for $485 instead of $500 is because of the transaction fee: 485*(1 + 2.5%) = 497.125</i>.
4. Keep the two gift cards and use the remain balance for future shopping.
 
The total cashback you can get out of this payment is $32.1. The calculation is:
 
```
1000*6% - 3.95*2 - 800 * 2.5% = 32.1
```
