## Ongoing Projects

### Online Question & Answer of Learning Computer Science

This project explores using Q & A to accommodate more computer science students and improve the quality of communication among instructors and students.

### Active Learning Classrooms

This project investigates the impacts of active learning environment on computer science students. Although active learning environment been studied in other fields extensively, it was rarely studied in the context of computer science education. This project intends to extend such discussions to computer science education and making progress on methods

### Retention of Online Coding Games

This project explores the retention of young students in massive online coding games. Massive online coding activities aim at introducing and attracting young students to computer science through interactive and gamified coding activities, but typically has a high abandonment rate.

### Automated Formative Feedback

I am collaborating with <a href="http://michael.tsikerdekis.com/" target="_blank">Michael Tsikerdekis</a>, another CS faculty from WWU on this project.

Feedback was historically studied as a subproblem of auto-grading. Here are a few things that we do different:

* Separating feedback from grading
* Near-real time feedback for updated code assignments
* Acceptance of incomplete code assignments
