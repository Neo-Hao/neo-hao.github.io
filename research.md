### Hour of Code

This project explores the retention of young students participating <a href="https://hourofcode.com/us" target="_blank">Hour of Code</a>, and possibly better measurement of the well-structured coding activities. Hour of Code is a massive online coding activities aiming at introducing and attracting young students to computer science through interactive and gamified coding activities. Hundred millions students around the globe participated in this activity annually.

The exposure of computer science to young students through online coding activities on a massive scale is a great achievement. Nevertheless, exposure does not guarantee motivation, and may not lead to further engagement. Historical data showed that many students got overwhelmed and gave up early.

Topics that aligned this project include:

* Identifying and retaining struggling students through machine learning techniques
* Designing and developing online coding games that better support learning of children
* Designing of a better software pipeline that supports learning of novice learners

### Online Question & Answer of Learning Computer Science

This project explores the interesting patterns of Q & A interactions of computer science students. It is important for students to learn how to ask effective questions that solicit good answers. By looking at the historical Q & A data from over thousands of students, we can gain insights into the important aspect of learning computer science.

Topics that aligned this project include:

* Identifying questions that need improvement through machine learning techniques
* Identifying interesting patterns of online Q & A
* Designing and developing online Q & A platforms that better support distant learning

### Active Learning Classrooms

This project investigates the impacts of active learning environments and instructional methods adapted to such environments on the academic performance of computer science students. Active learning classrooms have been studied in other fields extensively, such as physics or chemistry. However, it was rarely studied in the context of learning & teaching of computer science. This project intends to extend such discussions to computer science education.
