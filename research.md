## Ongoing Projects

### Active Learning Classrooms

This project investigates the impacts of active learning environments and instructional methods adapted to such environments on the academic performance of computer science students. Active learning classrooms have been studied in other fields extensively, such as physics or chemistry. However, it was rarely studied in the context of learning & teaching of computer science. This project intends to extend such discussions to computer science education.

A paper under this project was accepted to <a href="https://sigcse2018.sigcse.org/authors/papers.html" target="_blank">The SIGCSE Technical Symposium 2018</a> (CS Education Research Strand) on Oct. 6th, 2018.

### Hour of Code

This project explores the retention of young students participating <a href="https://hourofcode.com/us" target="_blank">Hour of Code</a>, and possibly better measurement of the well-structured coding activities. Hour of Code is a massive online coding activities aiming at introducing and attracting young students to computer science through interactive and gamified coding activities. Hundred millions students around the globe participated in this activity annually.

The exposure of computer science to young students through online coding activities on a massive scale is a great achievement. Nevertheless, exposure does not guarantee motivation, and may not lead to further engagement. Historical data showed that many students got overwhelmed and gave up early.

This project explores how to identify and retain struggling students through machine learning techniques.

### Retention of Students in Large-Scale Classes

This project explores identifying and facilitating struggling students in large-scale computer science classes through machine learning techniques.

### Training of Pre-Service Teachers in Computer Science

This project explores the pipeline of training K-12 pre-service teachers in Computer Science, and its efficacy measurement.
